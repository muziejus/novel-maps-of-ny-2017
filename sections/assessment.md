#### Participation

**10%** The success of any course is directly related to the levels of engagement
brought both by the instructor and the students. As such, class participation
is vitally important. Similarly, though attendance is logically required for
class participation, it is not sufficient. This class requires active
participation both inside the classroom and outside.  

You can miss up to three meetings without penalty, and you can use these
opportunities tactically, to provide space and time to either fulfill other
obligations or recuperate from the previous night. I don’t care why you didn’t
come. I start to care with the fourth absence, and I start to require
documentation. Repeated unexcused absence quickly gobbles up the class
participation component of the grade and begins to threaten your ability to
even *pass* the course.

In a discussion-oriented class, “active participation” involves the following
components. All of these are necessary to receive maximum points for
participation:

* being in class on time and staying in the classroom,
* arriving having done the reading for that day,
* having considered the reading and found points of entry into class discussion via questions about specific passages,
* participating in class discussion in ways that build upon contributions from others, and
* refraining from the use of electronic devices.

#### JavaScript Homework

**20%** Every week, for the Wednesday class, the respective problem set for
that week in [*The JavaScripting English
Major*](http://the-javascripting-english-major.org) will be due. The
answers should be emailed to me before class on Wednesday, and you should
bring your homework to class on Wednesday as well, where we will correct it as
a group.

*The JavaScripting English Major* is a course I am preparing, so your feedback
is very useful. Most of the chapters dovetail with the chapters in *Eloquent
JavaScript*, and if my description of a feature is insufficient, please look
to the Haverbeke text for more information. Crockford’s *JavaScript: The Good Parts* is more for reading on the side, if you find the programming aspects of
the course especially interesting.

#### Dérives

**20%** You will undertake two
[dérives](http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/theory.html) during the semester.
In both, you will get lost in Manhattan (and beyond?), while also documenting
and tracking yourself. In order to direct your dérive, you will use either the
[Derive App](http://deriveapp.com/s/v2/)for your smartphone or a set of cards
printed out ahead of time. In order to track the dérive, you are required to
trace your path and take notes on a [Field Papers
atlas](http://fieldpapers.org/compose#14/40.7220/-73.9924) and, if possible,
track yourself using GPS (the Derive App, if you let it, will save your
route).

During the course of the dérive, which can last hours, you should reflect on
the readings we have already done for the class, both in what you observe
while getting lost, but also in the process of getting lost itself. This is a
time for [psychogeography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychogeography), not
wandering listlessly about while checking the ’Gram. Stroll without
headphones; look around and feel the environment around you.
  
At the end, you will write up a short (1,100--1,250 words) report for each
dérive, including textual references from our readings. The report will be
joined by the original Field Papers atlas with notes. You can and are
encouraged to use other forms of media to supplement the report.

Finally, you will create a Leaflet map tracing your two dérives, to be hosted
on GitHub.

#### Presentation

**15%** You will give a short presentation on one of the novels we
are reading. This presentation should be about five minutes long and introduce
another writer’s views on the novel. Usually, this means looking up a book
review. Most of the books will have been reviewed by at least one of the *New
York Times* or *New York Review of Books*, but you can look for other reviews
from newspapers and magazines. The presentation should summarize the review
and include your thoughts on the review having read (at least some of) the
novel in question. For guidelines on giving a good presentation, see [my
webpage on presentation tips](http://moacir.com/courses/presentation-tips/).

#### Final project

**35%** Throughout the semester, you will be building a project based on one
of the novels in the class and its relationship to New York City. This project
will be a website, hosted on GitHub. Because it must contain at least one
Leaflet map, thematically the project will benefit from tracing certain
geographies in the novel of your choice and reproducing them online. The
result of the project should not be a fixed conclusion, but, rather, a new
series of questions prompted by your thinking about the novel geographically.
That is, what does the map you create tell you about the novel that you did
not previously know? What kinds of future avenues of inquiry open up because
of it?

You should be thinking about the project as early as possible, even
considering from the discussion on the first day which novel you may want to
choose for your focus and jumping ahead on it. Right before Thanksgiving, you
will send me a short outline of the project, a précis, that describes the
structure of the site (a “wireframe”), the content, and what kinds of
questions you will be investigating. During the last week of the course, we
will have time in class to troubleshoot technical problems, and on the last
class, you will give a quick, five-minute presentation about your project.
Over the following week, you will complete the project.

Hitting every deadline is crucial, so being late on any of these three points
(précis, presentation, final submission) will hurt your final grade.
