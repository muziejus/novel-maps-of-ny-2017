Designed for English majors and minors, this course examines three intertwined
questions: What is literature? Why do we read it? and How do we read it? As we
will see, any attempt to answer these three questions will take us through
various historical, spatial, political, and cultural fields. More precisely,
the course will follow a path of engaging with primarily American,
English-language aesthetic objects (poems, plays, novels, short stories,
essays—while also incorporating films and other, “newer” technologies of
aesthetic production) alongside a wider scholarly apparatus that has tried to
codify, restrict, (de)politicize, champion, demystify, appropriate, critique,
quantify, or simply complicate those objects. In so doing, we will see how the
study of literature has several histories, geographies, and politics in its
relationship with various cultures.
