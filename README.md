# English 101 2017

I am teaching “Introduction to the Study of Literature,” or “English 101,” in
the Spring of 2017 at NYU. 

This repository is an attempt to use
[MultiMarkdown](http://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-5/) in order to
generate both a [handsome
webpage](https://muziejus.github.io/english-101-2017/syllabus.html) and a
[handsome pdf](https://muziejus.github.io/english-101-2017/syllabus.pdf) of the
syllabus at the same time. This is (not) surprisingly rather tricky. However,
this is also a template for future syllabi, and I encourage others to tweak
this work.

## Structure

The main file in this syllabus is `syllabus.mmd`. This is a MultiMarkdown file
setting all of the metadata and building up the structure of the syllabus. Very
little actual text is in this file, as that is all delegated to the files in
the folder `sections/`.

The metadata includes calls to three LaTeX files (available in
`latex-support/`), but it also has an `html header` and `html footer` set,
which provide html-specific text that gets skipped for LaTeX. Most importantly,
at the end of `html footer`, there are a few jQuery commands that go back
through the html as it exists and fill in text strings.

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/muziejus/english-101-2017.git
cd english-101-2017
mmd syllabus.mmd
mmd2tex syllabus.mmd
xelatex syllabus.tex
```

`mmd` is MultiMarkdown. Fletcher Penney describes how to install it [on the
official site](http://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-5/installation.html),
but for Mac, assuming you have homebrew installed, it’s as easy as:

```
brew install --HEAD multimarkdown
```

A new version of `mmd` is required, because functionality like `html footer` is
a recent addition.

`xelatex` is [XeLaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XeTeX). It is installed as
part of [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) and/or
[MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex).

## The html version

`mmd syllabus.mmd` creates a file, `syllabus.html`, which is a self-contained
version of the syllabus, styled with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com). As a
result, it has a pleasant, generic look, a functioning navbar, responsive
layout, and a spy that updates the navbar based on where you are scrolling. The
navbar is built in `sections/navbar.html`, and it is only transcluded when
outputting to html. However, traces of its presence remain when outputting to
TeX. 

Because all of the html-specific stuff is done in the metadata, the html
version cannot make use of the metadata in the same way the TeX version can. As
a result, the navbar and jQuery commands in `html footer` must be edited by
hand.

## The TeX/pdf version

The pdf version is generated by XeLaTeX, as noted above. XeLaTeX uses the
[fontspec](http://ctan.org/pkg/fontspec) package to set its fonts. In this
repository, the fonts are set explicitly in `latex-support/second-header.tex`.
If you don’t have [EB
Garamond](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/EB+Garamond) or
[DejaVu](http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page) installed, XeLaTeX will throw
a fit. Of course, you could comment out those lines from
`latex-support/second-header.tex` or install the fonts. They are free.

There is also rudimentary support for bibliographies, but I’ve not yet
formalized it.

## Issues / roadmap

It feels like some kind of post-mmd parsing will have to be done. Urls defined
in the metadata turn into gibberish in `mmd2tex`, the processor doesn’t skip
the line to transclude the navbar file, and there are a few other changed I
would like to make to the how the final pdf version renders. The html side was
easy. This, though…

But enough hacking’s gone on here for me to be able to fill out the syllabus
with the actual plans for the actual course!

Additionally, the html file should be `index.html`, so that this repository can
be served by github pages, which would also let me host the pdf syllabus that
way.

## Credits

This is a large reworking of a previous course I taught at NYU, “[Does It Work?](https://github.com/muziejus/does-it-work)” in
autumn 2016.

In order to get the syllabus to sound “NYUish,” I copied (sometimes very
heavily) from a syllabus prepared by my colleague at NYU, [Jini
Watson](http://english.fas.nyu.edu/object/JiniWatson.html). She was also
helpful in giving me a sense of what kinds of assignments and homework students
could expect at this university. Useful info for someone who’s not taught in a
US context in over half a decade!

The bravery to create a `LaTeX` syllabus using the `memoir` class was fueled by
Kieran Healy’s [custom LaTeX
templates](http://kjhealy.github.com/latex-custom-kjh). I’ve greatly simplified
his setup, however.

This structure of this GitHub syllabus was once based on Mark Sample's
[Videogame Studies](https://github.com/samplereality/videogame-studies)
syllabus, in how it is presented on GitHub.
